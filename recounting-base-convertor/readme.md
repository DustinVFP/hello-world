this is a base convertor.

this is probably not very useful being the amount of processing power it takes
(it recounts the number instead of doing a proper conversion)
and the output is an array not a proper int value

instructions to use:

1: compile `g++ main.cpp -o main.exe`
2: run in command line
3: follow the in program instructions
