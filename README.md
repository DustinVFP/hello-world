# hello-world
just a test made to complete the tutorial guide, will probably be used for ideas and random things

this was originally made as part of githubs beginners guide

each seperate thing that goes into here will be put into its own folder

don't expect accurate names or quality code as this repo is going to be mostly random ideas and experiments

as for me well hi i am dustin
i do things, right now i know a little bit of basic C++ but i don't currently know how to do anything beyond console applications 
i also have an interest in web development
